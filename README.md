# Image-Processing-GUI

â€‹	This project is for my computer engineering study's image processing course. We therefore have a GUI with image manipulations.

An application that enables users to upload an image and carry out a variety of image processing operations, such as adjusting brightness and contrast, cropping and resizing, applying filters and effects, and detecting and removing noise or unwanted elements in the image, is one potential project idea for my image processing GUI.

Additionally, our GUI has tools for image segmentation and analysis.

> Overall, our project on image processing with a GUI is a great chance for you to put your computer engineering knowledge to use in a useful and fascinating area of study.
